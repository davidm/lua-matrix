v 0.2.8: 2007-08-26
	[ Michael Lutz ]
	- fixed rotr and rotl for rotating type 'complex','symbol' and 'tensor'
	- mulscalar is now mulnum, divscalar is now divnum, mul/div a complex number or a string,
		strings first get checked if they can be converted to a complex number (what returns a
		complex matrix) and if that fails they get converted to a symbol (what returns a symbol matrix)
	- require "matrix" will return 'matrix, complex' just for convinience
	- matrix.size will now returns the correct size of tensors
	- function matrix.div returns rank on failed invertion of m2
	- function matrix.det, was adjusted to better combine complex and number matrices
		and made sure it finds the element nearest to 1 or -1
	- function dogauss, was updated to handle complex and number matrices in one
	- tweaked some utility functions, should speed up number matrices at least
	- updated matrix.latex to support all types of matrices
	- matrix.tostring can now also format the output, and was updated to handle all types better
	- matrix.print now just calls matrix.tostring
	- updated test_matrix.lua
	- added fit (curve fitting to LuaMatrix package)
	[ David Manura ]
	- tweaked matrix.sqrt and matrix.root function;
		replaced "dist1 > dist or dist1 == dist" with "dist1 >= dist"
	- tweaked get_abs_avg function
	- added function matrix.normf ( mtx ), returns the norm abs of a matrix
	- added function matrix.normmax ( mtx ), returns the biggest abs(element)
	- added __pow to symbol
	- added abs() and sqrt() to symbol
	- fixed some global variables, that were allocated

v 0.2.7: 2007-08-19
	- added __div to metatable and the corresponding matrix functions( matrix.div(m1,m2); matrix.divscalar(m1,num) )
	- updated square root function, now returns to the matrix the average error of the calculated to the original matrix
	- added matrix.root function (from David Manura/http://www.dm.unipi.it/~cortona04/slides/bruno.pdf)
		to calculate any root of a matrix, returns same values as matrix.sqrt
	- added function matrix.rotl and matrix.rotr, for rotate left and rotate right

v 0.2.6: 2007-08-12
	- added patch#5 from DavidManura, fixes symbolic matrices handling
	- added sqrt function to function list, thx David for the hint, that some matrices don't convergent
	- added print function for rank3 tensors
	- added solve function, for symbolic matrices, tries to solve a symbolic matrix so that is numeric again
	- tocomplex converts to a complex matrix, remcomplex removes the complex metatable and returns its
		string/number value

v 0.2.5: 2007-08-11
	- added path#4 from DavidManura
		It contains some doc updates, fixed handling mtx^-1 for singular matrices,
		and a few checks that can be useful.
	- added setting up of a vector as matrix{1,2,3}

v 0.2.4
	- added patch#3 from DavidManura, fixes negative exponent
	- removed concat, added concath (concat horizontal) and concatv (concat vertical)
	- removed get from all commands, all commands return a matrix even those only changing
		the input matrix itself, except getelement and setelement
	- submatrix is now subm, and dogaussjordan is now dogauss
	- __tostring returns matrix.tostring, matrix.tostring returns a simple string with the matrix elements
	- __call; e.g. mtx(arg), will return matrix.print(mtx,arg)
	- added function matrix.cross( v1,v2 ) to get the cross product of 2 matrices e.g. m1[3][1], m2[3][1]
		to get the scalar product of these you have to do m1:scalar( m2 );
		to create a vector do matrix{{ 1,2,3 }}^'T'

v 0.2.3
	- some optimising, in parts where complex and normal matrix are separate anyways
	- added patch from DavidManura; matrix^0 returning the identitiy matrix, makes a lot sense
		print and printf merged, scalar multiply fixed, and __unm and __tostring added, 'good to know'

v 0.2.2
	updated matrix function to suit new complex functions, function names
		should become more stable now
	matrix can now be loaded via local matrix = require "matrix"
		or local matrix = dofile( "matrixfile" ), but require is better and faster
		when loading multiple times

v 0.2.1
	updated matrix functions to suit new complex functions

v 0.2.0
	changed matrix functions to use the updated
		complex number functions; makes a lot less code
		now complex and normal matrices share the same functions
		one can add/sub/mul complex and normal matrices, returning a complex matrix

v 0.1.6
	optimised functions a bit
	changed matrix.getinv to matrix.invert
	matrix:new is now matrix.new, 'matrix' should only provide functions
		added mtx = matrix( ... ); as matrix.new( ... )
	matrix functions only return tables with metatable of first argument matrix
	changed complex functions to
		matrix.c<func_name>; e.g. matirx.cadd; matrix.csub
	added: function matrix.cconjugate, returns the conjuagte complex matrix

v 0.1.5
	written complex functions from normal matrices
	added metatable handling for overloading operators

v 0.1.4
	added complex add on, to be able to handle
	complex elements in the format declaired in 'complex'

v 0.1.3
	added many functions also getdet and dogaussjordan
		only defined one way to get the determinant, so we are
		slow here in certain cases where matrices have a triangle shape for exsample

v 0.1.2
	object returns mainly internal errors for lighter code,
	structure should be no checks

v 0.1.0
	matrix
	structure of matrix m[i][j]
	added simple operations +-..
