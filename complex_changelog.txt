
complex changelog:

v 0.3.0: 2007-08-26
	- fixed print function
	- fixed call behaviour of complex number
	- __unm now directly alters the complex number instead of calling a complex function
	- changed cmplx to imag (imaginary), for better understand of what is the real
		and what is the imaginary part
	- changed convpolar, to take as first argument the radius and second the angle
		now both have to be given but is more conform to the polar function,
		that returns radius, phi
	- updated test_complex.lua

v 0.2.9: 2007-08-13
	- complex.tonumber is now complex.tostring, it will still return a number
		if it only has a real part, use tostring( cmplx ) to make sure it
		always returns a string

v 0.2.8: 2007-08-11
	- metatable functions such as __add;__sub ... didn't return an error if it couldn't be calculated
		now the complex.add function will return an error
	- topolar is not polar, and topolardeg is now polardeg
	- exp returns now e^(complexnumber)
	- convpolar returns polar coordinates as carthesic complex number
	- sqrt now calcs the sqrt of a complex number
	- added changelog file and *.zip
v 0.2.7:
	- optimised functions with ...
	- complex.len is now complex.abs
v 0.2.6
	- optimised metatable functions
	- added __call behaviour, prints the complex number
v 0.2.5
	- added option formatstr in complex.tonumber
	- added __tostring, is the same as complex.tonumber, but it always returns a string
	- added __concat so when one does "complex: "..cx, will do the right thing
		doesn't work with table.concat unfortunatly
v 0.2.4
	- changed to normal module loading via require rather than dofile
		e.g. "local complex = require "complex", if its on the call folder
		very good so one can decide for oneself to have complex global or local
	- added license
	- changed function name tocomplex to complex.to
v 0.2.3
	- rewritten tocomplex, clear structure, can be used as 'if tocomplex( arg ) then'
	- added fast function complex.new( real,cmplx ), not invoking any checks
v 0.2.2
	- changed tocomplex, to that it only returns a complex table if the input is
	either a table holding 2 numbers as first elemenst or a number or a string
	representing a complex number as defined
	else it returns nil, so one can do "if tocomplex( arg ) then"
v 0.2.1 added cx:set( real,complex ) to set real and complex
	real,complex = cx:get() and cx:is(real,complex)
